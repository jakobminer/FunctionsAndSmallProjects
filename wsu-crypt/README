A block-encryption algorithm based on Twofish and SKIPJACK

Contents:
	wsu-crypt.c 	-source code
	plaintext.txt	-sample plaintext
	key.txt			-sample key
	Makefile		-compile program
	README			-this document

NOTE: Requires a 64bit key(hex). I don't know what will happen if
	an invalid key is given. I ran out of time to test it.

To build:
	$ make

To use:
	$ ./wsu-crypt -e/-d -in <inputfile> -out <outputfile> -k <key>

	arguments may appear in any order, 
	but files must follow their corresponding flag

Known bugs:
	the encryption algorithm seems to trip up on newlines. 
	I have spent time debugging but am out of time to fix, given
	my current implementation.

	the encryption will hang if given an unusually large file. Due
	to the way I translated plaintext to hex with a pipe(), if the
	pipe overfills before finishing translating the input file, it will hang.
